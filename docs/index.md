      Como applies in artistic creation and pedagogy, workshops, as well as to education and rehabition. Specific applications are derived from the generic framework, such as CoMo Education, Como-Rehabiliation or CoMo-Vox (in collaboration with Radio France, supported by the Ministere of Education).
