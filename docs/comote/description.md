# CoMote

CoMote is a smartphone applications (iOS and Android) that allows for streaming motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) from the smartphone to desktop applications using either the OSC protocol or Websockets. The network's setup is facilitated by the use of a QR code generated by the targeted remote application receiving the motion sensor data.

CoMote is especially designed for the CoMo applications family that enables real-time interaction between gestures/movements and sounds. Nevertheless, the CoMote application can be used with any software that makes use of the OSC protocol.

CoMote and the CoMo applications are software designed and developed by IRCAM in the Sound-Music-Movement-Interaction team (UMR STMS).

## Technical details

The CoMote application is open-source and available on Github: [https://github.com/ircam-ismm/comote](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/comote).

### Sensor format

One of the main goal of the application is to provide unified axis and units across the different platforms. For this reason, we choose to follow a specification derived from Web Standards that is described in []()

### Integration

To integrate the CoMote application within your own application, we provide 2 different related packages for Node.js and Max/MSP. You can find more information on our dedicated github repository [https://github.com/ircam-ismm/comote-helpers](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/comote-helpers).

The Max/MSP package can be directly downloaded at the following url [https://github.com/ircam-ismm/comote-helpers/releases/latest/download/CoMote.zip](https://github.com/ircam-ismm/comote-helpers/releases/latest/download/CoMote.zip)

<!-- If you want to adapt existing application using R-IoTs to CoMote, you can follow the conversion guidelines described [here](https://ircam-ismm.github.io/misc/riot-devicemotion-compatibility.html#smartphone-and-r-iot-axes) -->
